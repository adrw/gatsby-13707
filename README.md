Example repo for https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13707

# Suspected Problems
- Rush relies on using symlinks to allow consuming local versions of packages that exist in the monorepo
- Rush also relies on a version set in the consuming package (non `*`) so that it can know whether to link or pull an older version from NPM
- Gatsby seems to by idiom rely on the theme package having `"*"` or is unable to follow the symlinks to the local versions of theme packages
